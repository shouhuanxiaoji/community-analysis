A future patch should probably track consecutive server errors and de-prioritize such servers. The code right now will always try servers in the order of configuration, so a bad server in the list will always be tried and may rely on timeout logic to try the next.\r\n* Various other cleanups to remove code duplication and for clarification.\r\n\r\nFixes Bug: #444\r\nFix By: Brad House (@bradh352)", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "7f3262312f246556d8c1bdd8ccc1844847f42787", "commit_date": "2023-08-18T15:35:49Z", "commit_message": "its not 1991 anymore, lower default timeout and retry count (#542)\n\nA lot of time has passed since the original timeouts and retry counts were chosen.

This PR implements a new linked list, skip list (sorted linked list), and hashtable implementation that are easy to use and hard to misuse. Though these implementations use more memory allocations than the prior implementation, the ability to more rapidly iterate on the codebase is a bigger win than any marginal performance difference (which is unlikely to be visible, modern systems are much more powerful than when c-ares was initially created).\r\n\r\nThe data structure implementation favors readability and audit-ability over performance, however using the algorithmically correct data type for the purpose should offset any perceived losses.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this PR is to facilitate future implementation for Issues #444, #135, #458, and possibly #301\r\n\r\nA couple additional notes:\r\n\r\nThe ares_timeout() function is now O(1) complexity instead of O(n) due to the use of a skiplist.\r\nSome obscure bugs were uncovered which were actually being incorrectly validated in the test cases.
