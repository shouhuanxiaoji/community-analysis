Because of\nthis, the configuration of the text console and Xorg layouts may differ.\nNot all combinations of Xorg layouts have a keymap in the kbd database.\nIt's inconvenient for users.\n\nTo solve this we can try converting the Xorg layout to a text console\nkeymap.\n\nTo access the XKB (X Keyboard Extension) database, you can use\nlibxkbcommon, which does not depend on the X11 libraries.\n\nlibxkbcommon is a keyboard keymap compiler and support library which\nprocesses a reduced subset of keymaps as defined by the XKB\nspecification [1].\n\nlibxkbcommon does not distribute a keymap dataset itself, other than for\ntesting purposes. The most common dataset is xkeyboard-config, which is\nused by all current distributions for their X11 XKB data [2].\n\nThere is a project that uses a similar approach to unify configurations.\nThis is console-setup [3].\n\nI talked with Anton Zinoviev and he helped me figure out their idea of\nswitching multiple layouts with a single key combination:\n\n> how you solved the problem of switching more than two layouts with one\n> key combination ?\n\nThe keys with ISO_Next_Group, for example the right Alt (keynumber 100),\nare defined like this:\n\nkeycode 100 = ShiftL_lock\nShiftL keycode 100 = ShiftR_lock\nShiftR keycode 100 = ShiftR_lock\nShiftL ShiftR keycode 100 = ShiftL_lock\n\nSo this key will work in the following way:\n\nno modifiers are active -> ShiftL is active\nShiftL is active -> ShiftL and ShiftR are active\nShiftL and ShiftR are active -> ShiftR is active\nShiftR is active -> no modifiers are active\n\nThe groups (the layouts) are placed in the following way:\n\nactive modifiers  1 group    2 groups    3 groups    4 groups\n----------------  -------    --------    --------    --------\nno modifier       group 1    group 1     group 1     group 1\nShiftL            group 1    group 2     group 2     group 2\nShiftR            group 1    group 2     group 3     group 4\nShiftL+ShiftR     group 1    group 1     group 1     group 3\n\nIn this way we have the following cycles:\n\n1 group: gr1->gr1->gr1->...\n2 groups: gr1->gr2->gr1->gr2->...\n3 groups: gr1->gr2->gr1->gr4->gr1->gr2->gr1->gr4->...\n4 groups: gr1->gr2->gr3->gr4->gr1->gr2->gr3->gr4->...\n\n--\nAnton Zinoviev\n\nThe difference with this implementation is that I am not trying to read\nand parse the XKB base files. I analyze the resulting xkb keymap.\n\n[1] https://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/index.html\n[2] https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig/\n[3] https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/console-setup.git\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexey Gladkov <gladkov.alexey@gmail.com>", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "f4daad01d085661d42d44f59879bc7577a0db256", "commit_date": "2023-10-03T11:20:08Z", "commit_message": "Use pkg-config for external dependencies\n\nThese days, many libraries have pkg-config files in which the authors\nthemselves specify the correct CFLAGS and LIBS.
