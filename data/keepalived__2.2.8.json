Inspecting src/magic.c in the \"file\" utility source\ncode shows that the call of utimensat() was made due to utimes() being\ncalled. glibc maps this to a call of utimensat().\n\nAlthough setting the flag, and hence preserving atime when ascertaining\nthe file type is not unreasonable, the atime will be modified anyway\nwhen the file is subsequently executed.

This is due to\nclose_and_restore() in src/magic.c only restoring the seconds field,\nand not the microseconds that utimes() can specify, and that\nutime()/utimes() update both the atime and mtime fields.

The\ndisadvantage of this is that to iterate through all checkers requires\niterating through all virtual servers, and all their real servers and\nthen for each real server the list of checkers. If there are\nrelatively few checkers compared to real servers, this will take longer\nthan using the checkers_queue, but using a queue per real server is\nstill fast, and the only time the code iterates through all the checkers\nis at startup/reload, other than dumping the configuration.\n\nSigned-off-by: Quentin Armitage <quentin@armitage.org.uk>", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "a970ed8892631db9faa24edf5496ed600d70e3bb", "commit_date": "2023-07-09T09:55:35Z", "commit_message": "all: add missing code from per process gprof profiling patch\n\nFixes commit 7ec6fe4 -
