If they do this\ntoday, the opened joystick will end up partially initialized (no name,\npath, mapping GUID, etc.) because HIDAPI_GetDeviceByIndex() will no\nlonger be able to find the SDL_HIDAPI_Device for the removed joystick.\n\nWorse still, joystick->hwdata->device becomes a dangling freed pointer\nthe next time HIDAPI_UpdateDeviceList() is called. This leads to a UAF\nwhen the application or SDL calls SDL_JoystickClose() on this joystick.\n\nFix all this by checking if the device no longer has any associated\njoysticks after calling UpdateDevice() and failing the open call if so.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 435e7ce663b7e568086c5dc0fb1bb889e41a3ed1)\n(cherry picked from commit 4aab2342e9aabc7e506952dbe5e021f3d3604929)", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": ["bugfix", "new-security-features"], "llama2-7b-chat": " This commit message can be categorized as \"Bug Fix\".
