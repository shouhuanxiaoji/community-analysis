(#12451)\n\nWhen loading a function from either RDB/AOF or a replica, it is essential not to\nfail on timeout errors. The loading time may vary due to various factors, such as\nhardware specifications or the system's workload during the loading process.\nOnce a function has been successfully loaded, it should be allowed to load from\npersistence or on replicas without encountering a timeout failure.\n\nTo maintain a clear separation between the engine and Redis internals, the\nimplementation refrains from directly checking the state of Redis within the\nengine itself. Instead, the engine receives the desired timeout as part of the\nlibrary creation and duly respects this timeout value. If Redis wishes to disable\nany timeout, it can simply send a value of 0.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2ee1bbb53baea26b442d602b0b3335176170736d)", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "ea1bc6f62327c44f8e438b21d6042ae46670096c", "commit_date": "2023-09-06T17:55:58Z", "commit_message": "Process loss of slot ownership in cluster bus (#12344)\n\nProcess loss of slot ownership in cluster bus\n\nWhen a node no longer owns a slot, it clears the bit corresponding\nto the slot in the cluster bus messages.
