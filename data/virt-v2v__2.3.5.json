We can detect this by\nlooking at the Windows registry.\n\nTo cope with this difference we need to add a guestcaps flag based on\nwhat we think the guest is expecting.  (We might also use the source\nhypervisor RTC setting, but it is not thought to be as reliable as\ninspecting the guest.)\n\nThis change simply adds the flag to guestcaps, and sets it to always\ntrue, so there is no change to the output.\n\nReviewed-by: Laszlo Ersek <lersek@redhat.com>", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "c5c9aa2f77ff65e986e05023d232d6bad3caaace", "commit_date": "2023-08-07T12:06:02Z", "commit_message": "Merge pull request #32 from weblate/weblate-libguestfs-virt-v2v-master\n\nTranslations update from Fedora Weblate", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "29222e1cea069287c246287361849ef85eb2b4f5", "commit_date": "2023-08-05T11:21:05Z", "commit_message": "Update translation files\n\nUpdated by \"Update PO files to match POT (msgmerge)\" hook in Weblate.\n\nTranslation: libguestfs/virt-v2v-master\nTranslate-URL: https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/libguestfs/virt-v2v-master/", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}, {"commit_oid": "41c53060c395fd002b30264596bf89a611b5ef34", "commit_date": "2023-08-05T11:21:05Z", "commit_message": "Translated using Weblate (Spanish)\n\nCurrently translated at 1.3% (18 of 1305 strings)\n\nTranslation: libguestfs/virt-v2v-docs-master\nTranslate-URL: https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/libguestfs/virt-v2v-docs-master/es/", "commit_author": "", "message_analysis": {"glm6b_2": [], "llama2_7b_chat": [], "manual": [], "noob_engine": []}}]}
